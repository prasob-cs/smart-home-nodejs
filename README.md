# Actions on Google: Smart Home sample using Node.js

This sample contains a fully functioning example of a Smart Home provider
cloud service designed to work with Actions on Google. This can be used with a
Actions Console project to create an Action interface to your IoT devices.
This sample includes everything you need to get started, including a mocked
user authentication service with sample users and a user web portal to
demonstrate the user experience when controlling their lights with your action.

An example of a Smart Home IoT cloud engine is written here. This project can be
integrated with a web portal for an interactive experience.

## Setup Instructions

See the developer guide and release notes at [https://developers.google.com/assistant](https://developers.google.com/assistant) for more details.

Clone the project and the included frontend as a subdirectory:

```
git clone https://github.com/prasob-cs/smart-home-nodejs.git
git clone https://github.com/prasob-cs/smart-home-frontend.git smart-home-nodejs/frontend
cd smart-home-nodejs
```

## Steps for testing with Google Assistant

### Create and set up project in Actions Console

1. Use the [Actions on Google Console](https://console.actions.google.com) to add a new project with a name of your choosing and click *Create Project*.
1. Select *Home Control*, then click *Smart Home*.

### Optional: Customize your action

1. From the top menu under *Develop*, click on *Invocation*.
1. Add your App's name. Click *Save*.
1. From the top menu under *DEPLOY*, click on *Directory Information*.
1. Add your App info, including images, a contact email and privacy policy. This information can all be edited before submitting for review.
1. Click *Save*.

### Add Request Sync and Report State
The Request Sync feature allows a cloud integration to send a request to the Home Graph
to send a new SYNC request. The Report State feature allows a cloud integration to proactively
provide the current state of devices to the Home Graph without a `QUERY` request. These are
done securely through [JWT (JSON web tokens)](https://jwt.io/).

1. Navigate to the
[Google Cloud Console API Manager](https://console.developers.google.com/apis)
for your project id.
1. Enable the [HomeGraph API](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/api/homegraph.googleapis.com/overview).
1. Navigate to the [Google Cloud Console API & Services page](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials)
1. Select **Create Credentials** and create a **Service account key**
    1. Create a new Service account
    1. Use the role Service Account > Service Account Token Creator
1. Create the account and download a JSON file.
   Save this as `src/smart-home-key.json`.

### Configure Cloud Firestore

1. Open your project in the [Firebase console](https://console.firebase.google.com/), and configure a Cloud Firestore database.
1. Configure a `users` collection with a default user and a few default fields

```
    users\
        1234
            fakeAccessToken: "123access"
            fakeRefreshToken: "123refresh"
            homegraph: false
```

### Deploy to Firebase Cloud Functions and Hosting

1. Run the following commands:

```
npm install
npm --prefix frontend install
npm run deploy
```

1. Open the web frontend URL.
1. Configure the virtual devices shown as you please. Click the cloud icon shown
   above at least one of them to enable it for cloud control.

### Start testing

1. Navigate back to the [Actions on Google Console](https://console.actions.google.com).
1. From the top menu under *Develop*, click on *Actions* (left nav). Click on *Add your first action* and choose your app's language(s).
1. Enter the URL for fulfillment: [`PROJECT_ID`](https://firebase.google.com/docs/projects/learn-more#project-id)`.web.app/smarthome`. and click *Done*.
1. On the left navigation menu under *ADVANCED OPTIONS*, click on *Account Linking*.
    1. Select *No, I only want to allow account creation on my website*. Click *Next*.
    1. For Linking Type, select *OAuth*.
    1. For Grant Type, select 'Authorization Code' for Grant Type.
    1. Under Client Information, enter the client ID and secret as defined `src/config-provider.ts`:
        * Client Id: `sampleClientId`
        * Client Secret: `sampleClientSecret`
    1. The Authorization URL: [`PROJECT_ID`](https://firebase.google.com/docs/projects/learn-more#project-id)`.web.app/fakeauth`
path.
    1. The Token URL: [`PROJECT_ID`](https://firebase.google.com/docs/projects/learn-more#project-id)`.web.app/faketoken`
    1. Click *Save*.
1. On the left navigation menu under *Test*, click on *Simulator*, to begin testing this app.

### Set up Account linking

1. On a device with the Google Assistant logged into the same account used
to create the project in the Actions Console, enter your Assistant settings.
1. Click Home Control.
1. Click the '+' sign to add a device.
1. Find your app in the list of providers.
1. Log in to your service.
1. Start using the Google Assistant in the Actions Console to control your devices. Try saying 'turn my lights on'.

:information_source: Assistant will only provide you control over items that are registered, so if you visit your front end and click the add icon to create a device your server will receive a new SYNC command.
